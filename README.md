Welcome to the Jukko developer SDK documentation. Follow our step-by-step instructions to
integrate Jukko and start monetizing while converting your app into a catalyst for social
impact today!

If you have any questions during the integration process, you can reach us at [devs@jukko.com](mailto:devs@jukko.com)
and we'll get back to you ASAP. Thanks for joining our movement to create a better world and
a better way of doing business.

### Integration

1. Add the following lines to your root project's `build.gradle` file:

        :::gradle
        allprojects {
            repositories {
                ....
                maven { url "https://dl.jukko.com/android-sdk" }
            }
        }


2. In your application's `build.gradle` add the following line to the dependencies list:

        :::gradle
        dependencies {
            compile 'com.jukko.sdk:jukko-sdk:1.0.0'
        }

### Usage

##### Initialization
Initialization has to be done before Jukko SDK can be customized and launched. The method will
need an API key and context object. The API key can be generated in the dashboard after registration.
You can register on [Jukko website](https://jukko.com).

```java
    JukkoSdk.getInstance().init(context, "API_KEY");
```


##### Showing an ad

You can show an ad by calling `showAd()` method of Jukko SDK:

```java
        JukkoSdk.getInstance().showAd(new JukkoSdkInterface.AdCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onClosed(JukkoSdkInterface.AdClosedEvent event) {
                //handle onClosed events here
            }
        });
```

When ad UI is closed, `onClosed()` callback will be called on the main thread. It will contain the following information:

1. `reason`: reason why the ad was closed. Possible values are:
    * `CLOSED_BY_USER`: Ad view was closed by user interaction.
    * `TIMEOUT`: API servers were unresponsive.
    * `NETWORK_CONNECTIVITY`: Network connectivity issue.
    * `FREQUENCY_CAPPING`: `showAd()` called before frequency capping timeout ended.
    * `ERROR`: Unspecified error. Look at the `message` field for description.
2. `message`: string containing extended description of reason.
3. `events`: list of events that happened with ad UI. May be `null`. Each event contains:
    * `timestamp` of the event (uses current timezone).
    * `adEvent` type of event. Possible values:
        * `LAUNCH`: Ad UI opened.
        * `CLOSE`: Ad UI closed.
        * `INTRO_SHOWN`: NPO campaign intro was shown to user.
        * `PROGRESS_SHOWN`: NPO campaign progress was shown to user.
        * `OUTRO_SHOWN`: NPO campaign outro was shown to user.
        * `AD_SHOWN`: Ad was shown to user.
        * `AD_URL_OPENED`: user clicked on URL that was opened in external browser.


##### Frequency capping

Jukko SDK allows developer to set frequency capping for ads. It counts time since the last time when an ad was closed
and ignores `showAd()` calls until frequency capping period ends. Frequency capping can be changed
using:

```java
    JukkoSdk.getInstance().setAdsFrequency(timeInSeconds);
```


##### Console logging

By default, Jukko SDK logs only important messages, like unrecoverable error reasons.

You can enable debug logging by calling:

```java
    JukkoSdk.getInstance().setDebugMode(true);
```
Log messages will contain `Jukko SDK` tag.


### Google Play Services

If user has Google Play services on their devices, SDK will automatically use user's
Advertising ID (GAID) and Limit Ad Tracking setting.

For more information about Google Advertising ID visit [this link](https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/ads/ad-id/).

### Requirements

Jukko SDK supports devices starting with Android 4.0 (API level 14). However, due to some older WebView version restrictions, ad UI won't be shown for Android prior to 4.4 (API level < 19) and SDK will only log some messages in console specifying this.
